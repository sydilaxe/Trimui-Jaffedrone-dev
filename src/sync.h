/* Wi-Fi sync between HI5 / Jaffedrone units (same protocol as HI5): each unit
 * broadcasts tempo, bar phase and transport over UDP ten times a second.
 * The lowest id (or the unit set to LEAD) leads; followers lock their
 * phase by trimming playback speed.
 *
 * Packet, little-endian:
 *   0 "HI5S"   4 version 1   5 playing   6 sync mode   7 flags (1: echo below)
 *   8 u32 unit id   12 f32 bpm   16 f64 position in 16ths at the send time:
 *     the one being heard, plus SYNC_WIRE_LEAD_US (older units send the one
 *     being made, which runs about that far ahead)
 *   24 u64 sender's clock at the send (us)
 *   32 u32 echo: the id of a unit heard   36 u64 the clock in its packet
 *   44 u32 us from hearing that packet to sending this one
 * Units from before the echo send only the first 32 bytes and ignore the
 * rest, so old and new units sync together. */
